This folder stores all the regular .py scripts.

To use these, you need to have the fetools library, which you can get by running `pip install fetools` from the command line.

*(The .pyz scripts in the [root folder](https://github.com/zseartcc/fe-toolbox) have fetools built in. Using those is probably easiest.)*
